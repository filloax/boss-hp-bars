**Ornstein - Souls-Like Boss HP Bars**
=======

Module for FoundryVTT that adds Dark Souls-like HP bars for bosses and other tokens.
![Demo](.github/readme/demo.gif)

Currently indev.

**Usage**
-----------

Until a UI is implemented, you can use the macros found in *compendium/macros/Souls-Like Boss HP Bars*. There you can find the *Enable Boss Bar on Token* and *Disable Boss Bar on Token* macros. Drop those from the compendium, into your macros hotbar (bottom of the screen), then click on a token and use the Enable macro. You should see a boss far representing the token's Bar 1 (usually HP).

**Upcoming features/to-do**
-----------

~~* An actual UI instead of using macros.~~ Done!
* Per-token settings for animation timing, disabling animations, color, visibility etc.
* Macro triggers for health percentages.
* Whatever comes to mind later


*But what about this is even souls-like?* Good point. Add a stamina meter to your games and that should give you the full experience.

**My other works**

This is my first Foundry VTT module! I also am part of the team of the massive [Revelations mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1536643474) for The Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth+, as programmer and video editor.
